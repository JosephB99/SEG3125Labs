This was done as a lab for my User Interfaces course.
Instructions and explanations on what the website does is attached in the PDF file, but it is worth noting 
that it is mentionned in the instructions that the website is only focused on UI and the website doesn't have to be functional,
but I went the extra mile and made the website fully functional. Adding, deleting, and tracking tactics fully works.
